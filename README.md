# Tangerine

> Tangerine is a collection of documentation, guides and packages that aims to formalize best-practices, patterns and abstractions that we use for React and general frontend development across Atlassian.

Tangerine is organised into 3 sections.

1. 📄 Docs - general docs (i.e. what _is_ tangerine)
2. 🐕 Guides - how to do specific things (i.e. building an SPA).
3. 📦 Packages - tools and utilities to speed up development (i.e. an implementation of an SPA router).

## Work in progress

We are working on creating PRs to bring stuff over from internal resources.

The first iteration of tangerine will contain [docs](./docs/README.md) and [guides](./guides/README.md) in markdown format. We may even publish packages from a basic monorepo setup.

From there, we will be build a website based off of the markdown documents that aims to bring together the docs, guides and packages into a cohesive source of truth.

## Contributing

While Tangerine is intended to be for Atlassians, by Atlassians, we welcome community involvement and contributions. All of the packages we publish here will be 100% open source.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how.
