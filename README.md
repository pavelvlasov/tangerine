# Tangerine

> Tangerine is a collection of documentation, guides and packages that aims to formalize best-practices, patterns and abstractions that we use for frontend development across Atlassian.

Tangerine is organised into 3 sections.

1. 📄 Docs - general docs (i.e. what _is_ tangerine)
2. 🐕 Guides - how to do specific things (i.e. building an SPA).
3. 📦 Packages - tools and utilities to speed up development (i.e. an implementation of an SPA router).

## Work in progress

We are working on creating PRs to bring stuff over from internal resources.

The first iteration of tangerine will contain docs and guides in markdown format. We may even publish packages from a basic monorepo setup.

From there, we will be build a website based off of the markdown documents that aims to bring together the docs, guides and packages into a cohesive source of truth.

## Contributing

While Tangerine is intended to be for Atlassians, by Atlassians, we welcome community involvement and contributions. All of the packages we publish here will be 100% open source.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how.
