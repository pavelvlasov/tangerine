# UI layer

The primary goal of UI components is to render an interface. This is where all the composition is
happening: a UI component consumes other UI components, services and state controllers.

All components should be considered “black box” by other components, they can only interact with
each other explicitly via their external API and explicit exports. By doing that, we are optimising
for future refactoring and scalability, and encouraging separation of concerns. In the ideal
scenario, any component on any level of the hierarchy can be moved to any level above by a simple
drag-and-drop, including being extracted into its own package.

While in the past we were adhering to the concept of
[presentational/container](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
components, in the new tangerine world it has become obsolete.

Because:

- when everything is a component and local state management is handled directly in components, the
  line between what is “presentational” and what is “container” is now very hard to define

- it interferes with the code readability and the flow of data, which is against patterns we are
  going for, where everything is composable

# Naming convention

All UI components should be structured in exactly the same way

- **index.js** - re-exports what is considered public API for this component
- **main.js** - this file contains the main logic of the component. It will compose different
  components, including various services/controllers, react context consumers and all other UI
  elements. Concerns that are not relevant for the actual component logic (like styles or
  translations, see the list below) should be extracted into their relevant files.
- messages.js - all translations for this component should be grouped here and exported as a
  default export.
- styled.js - all styled components that are used in production code live there. It should not
  contain components that are used for test purposes.
- types.js - all types for this component live here. The only exception are Props and State, that
  could live in the main.js if they are small enough.
- constants.js - if a component requires to define a lot of constants they should be extracted
  into this file. There is no need to extract all constants right away though, use your best
  judgement here.
- test.js - unit tests for the component or its utils. It is recommended to write unit tests for
  all components that have logic worth testing. It is unnecessary to write unit tests for
  components that only render other component with no logic inside, since we also have types and
  examples to help with code coverage. Important: this file should contain actual unit tests, not
  shallow snapshots of the component with the description "component should render".
- assets - images and other static resources required by this component.
- examples.js - render examples of usage of this component. See more details in
  [Examples for UI components](../../components/components-types/ui/examples.md).
- utils.js - utils that are specific for this particular component.
- utils - when a component needs to do a lot of transformations or other operations, a single
  "utils.js" is not enough. When this happens they can be put in a folder instead and separated
  into files. In this case, every util should be put into its own file with the name that reflects
  name of that util, and has unit tests in a separate file with the name name-of-the-util.test.js.

## Rules

### [import/no-parent-imports](/packages/eslint-plugin-tangerine/rules/import/no-parent-imports)

The below configuration restricts importing parent ui components within the 'ui' directory as per [ui structure]('./structure.md) guidelines.

#### Config

```js
'tangerine/import/no-parent-imports': [
  'error',
  {
    basePath: path.join(appRoot, 'src'),
    srcRoot: 'src',
    dirs: ['ui'],
    message:
      '\nSee https://github.com/atlassian/tangerine/tree/master/guides/code/app/apps/structure/ui-layer for more details',
  },
],
```
