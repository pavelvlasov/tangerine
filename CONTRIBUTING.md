# Contributing

> We're currently working on templates for contributing documents for these and will have them soon.

For most contributions, we prefer you raise an issue for discussion. Once it's clear that there is an action to take on the issue, then a pull request can be made. For minor tweaks and clear bugs, please feel free to just issue a pull request.

All documentation and guides are located in `docs/` and `guides/`, respectively. They're organised into corresponding `.md` files for each item.
