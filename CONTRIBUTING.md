# Contributing

> We're currently working on templates for contributing documents for these and will have them soon.

While we prefer pull requests to issues, if you are unsure about a contribution you'd like to make or have questions, feel free to raise an issue.

All documentation and guides are located in `docs/` and `guides/`, respectively. They're organised into corresponding `.md` files for each item.
